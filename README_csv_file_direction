CSV file direction
***NOTE: index always starts from  zero***

1) Part-cell relation csv file
(2-D array, shape = (1 x num_part): index = part_index and value = cell_index)
  - for instance: 7 part with 2 cell
  [0,0,0,1,1,1,1]
  indicate cell 0 includes part (0,1,2)
           cell 1 includes part (3,4,5,6)

2) Part-task relation csv file
(2-D array, shape = (1 x num_part) : index = part_index and value = task_index)
- for instance: 7 part with 5 task
  [0,1,2,2,3,3,4]
  indicate task 0 includes part (0)
           task 1 includes part (1)
           task 2 includes part (2,3)
           task 3 includes part (4,5)
           task 4 includes part (6)

3) Sociometry matrix csv file
2-D array, shape = (num_worker x num_worker) : index = (worker i, worker j) and value = sociometry_score)
- for instance: 5 worker x 5 worker
  [[0,5,4,1,1],[0,0,3,1,1],[0,0,0,1,1],[0,0,0,0,3],[0,0,0,0,0]]
  sociometry_score has only one value for each worker in pair and does not count for him/herself score
  indicate w0,w1 sociometry_score = 5
           w0,w2 sociometry_score = 4
           w0,w3 sociometry_score = 1
           w0,w4 sociometry_score = 1
           w1,w2 sociometry_score = 3
           w1,w3 sociometry_score = 1
           w1,w4 sociometry_score = 1
           w2,w3 sociometry_score = 1
           w2,w4 sociometry_score = 1
           w3,w4 sociometry_score = 3

4) Demand matrix csv file
(2-D array, shape = (num_part x 1 ) : index = (part_index) and value = part_demand)
- for instance: 7 part x 4 period
[[1],[2],[3],[0],[5],[1],[0]]
indicate p0 demand = 1
         p1 demand = 2 
         p2 demand = 3
         p3 demand = 0
         p4 demand = 5
         p5 demand = 1
         p6 demand = 0

5) part standard processing time csv file
(2-D array, shape = (num_part x 1) : index = (part_index) and value = processing_time)
- for instance: 7 part
[[1],[2],[3],[0],[5],[1],[0]]
indicate p0 processing_time = 1
         p1 processing_time = 2
         p2 processing_time = 3
         p3 processing_time = 1
         p4 processing_time = 5
         p5 processing_time = 1
         p6 processing_time = 0

6) worker part skill-coefficient matrix csv file
(2-D array, shape = (num_worker x num_part) : index = (worker_index, part_index) and value = skill_coefficient)
- for instance: 2 worker x 5 part
[[0.7,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1.3,1.3]]
indicate w0 skill coefficeint of part 0 =  0.7
         w0 skill coefficeint of part 1 =  1
         w0 skill coefficeint of part 2 =  1
         w0 skill coefficeint of part 3 =  1
         w0 skill coefficeint of part 4 =  1
          w1 skill coefficeint of part 0 =  1
          w1 skill coefficeint of part 1 =  1
          w1 skill coefficeint of part 2 =  1
          w1 skill coefficeint of part 3 =  1.3
          w1 skill coefficeint of part 4 =  1.3

7) worker task skill-coefficient matrix csv file
